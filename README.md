# Hiyori-chan Simulator
[__Hiyori-chan Simulator__](https://hiyori.club) (ヒヨリちゃんシミュレーター), or Hiyori-Sim, is an attempt to recreate the home page (or My Page) of the original _Princess Connect!_ game released by CyberAgent and Cygames in 2015 and subsequently shut down in 2016. Now you too can finally hear Hiyori call you Senpai once again.

## Information
Hiyori-chan Simulator currently provides the following functionality:
* Ability to select all released partners
* Playback of all partners' My Page dialogues

This is a non-profit personal project created by someone who had previously only dabbled in web development once in 2014. Partner/Card/Dialogue data was previously collected by the [_Princess Connect! Memorial_](http://pricone.nekonikoban.org) website. All characters and assets are not provided on this repository and belong to their respective owners.

## Translation
Hiyori-chan Simulator is currently available in Japanese and English.

As of May 13, 2020, 17 out of 55 partners are fully translated in English (members of Twinkle Wish, Little Lyrical, Carmina, New Generations, Labyrinth, Hatsune/Shiori, and DJ). As this is a personal project, I am not currently looking for help for other characters' English translations.

## Contact
If you need to bother me, feel free to contact me on Discord (`Cloud668#8249`) or Twitter [@Cloud668](https://twitter.com/cloud668) in English, Japanese, or Chinese (that doesn't necessarily mean I will reply in the language you contact me in). I play on the Japanese Re:Dive server as Inari.
